# Automated Wafer Map Failure Pattern Recognition

## Executive Summary
In this project, I have endeavored to harness the power of machine learning to transform the wafer map failure pattern recognition process within the semiconductor industry. By transitioning from manual inspection to an automated system, my objective has been to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of semiconductor fabrication, which is critical for enhancing manufacturing yield.

### Key Findings:

- I found that automated recognition of wafer map failure patterns greatly minimizes manual labor and the associated errors.
- The One-VS-One multi-class SVM model that I implemented demonstrated high accuracy in classifying defects.
- Feature engineering proved to be a crucial aspect, with density, radon, and geometry-based features facilitating accurate pattern detection.
- I identified opportunities for further refinement through advanced algorithm tuning, ensemble methods, and more extensive feature engineering.

## Introduction

My project centered on automating the recognition of failure patterns using the extensive WM-811K dataset, which includes over 811k wafer maps. The primary challenges involved preprocessing to handle missing values and managing the variance in dimensionality. After a comprehensive literature review, I chose to employ One-VS-One multi-class SVMs due to their effectiveness in handling multi-class classification challenges.

## Step 1: Define the Problem

### Dataset Summary
I converted the dataset from MATLAB (.mat) files to Python pickle (.pkl) files to simplify manipulation and analysis.

### Data Preprocessing
- I discarded data that lacked failure type labels.
- I introduced 'WaferMapDim' as a new feature to standardize the varying dimensions of wafers.
- I decided to focus on 25,519 instances that exhibited actual failure patterns to optimize the utility of the data.
- I noted an imbalance in the target distribution, a common occurrence in real-world datasets.

### Data Visualization
My initial visualization of the data revealed significant variation in failure patterns, which led me to pursue advanced feature engineering techniques.

## Step 2: Prepare the Data

### Data Transformation
- **Density-based Features**: I segmented the wafer maps into 13 parts to calculate defect densities, which are crucial for identifying certain failure types.
- **Radon-based Features**: By applying radon transforms, I derived 40 standardized features that can cater to various wafer sizes.
- **Geometry-based Features**: I extracted six features from the most prominent regions of the wafers to gain valuable geometric insights.

## Step 3: Choose Algorithms

Guided by the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet, I selected One-VS-One multi-class SVMs, confident in their established success in similar tasks.

## Step 5: Improve Results

- **Algorithm Tuning**: I fine-tuned the model parameters to achieve significant performance enhancements.
- **Ensemble Methods**: I experimented with combining predictions from multiple models, which showed potential for improved accuracy.
- **Extreme Feature Engineering**: I endeavored to maximize the decomposition and aggregation of attributes to uncover more distinctive features.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

My project has successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of One-VS-One multi-class SVMs in classifying various wafer failures, significantly outperforming manual inspection methods. Although the current results are promising, there is still room for improvement in terms of algorithmic precision and feature engineering depth.

I strongly recommend that the industry adopts these intelligent systems to elevate productivity and precision in quality control procedures.

## Future Work

- **Model Refinement**: I plan to explore more sophisticated algorithms and neural networks for the identification of complex patterns.
- **Data Augmentation**: To address the issue of class imbalance, I will consider generating synthetic data for underrepresented classes.
- **Process Efficiency**: I aim to enhance the efficiency and scalability of the feature extraction and model training processes.
